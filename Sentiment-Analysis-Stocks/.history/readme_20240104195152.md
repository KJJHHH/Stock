## Pretrained Model
### Models
The following pretrained models are based on transformer structure and pretrained to do different task.

If maximum token length for all news in the day is less than 512:
- ***FinBert***
    - Model Name: ~ 
    - Can Process data with tokens less than 512
    - Finbert is bert based model finetuned with finance text data\

Else:
- ***Longformer***
    - Model Name: ~ 
    - Can Process data with tokens up to 4096
    - Not finetuned to do financial tasks
    - Warning when loading model: some parameters (weights) cannot be downloaded successfully (might need finetune to get more precise result)



### Data Preprocess
- Translation

### Decide Scores with Pretrained model
- Translation: the pretrained model need 

## Finetuning Pretrained Models
- Finetuning LongFormer
    - Padding tokens to maximum tokens in training dataset
- Finetuning Finebrt
    - Cannot train Finbert since the maximum acceptable tokens lengths is less than maximum tokens in training dataset
    - <span style="color:pink">Possible solution: chunk the text</span>

## Result and Baseline
> With transaction fee .004 for each transaciton
> Annualised

### Pretrained model
- Utilising pretrained model to score the snetiment and make decision based ob the score
