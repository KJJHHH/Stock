   "The US Department of Labor announced that the annual increase rate of CPI (Consumer Price Index) last December last year was 6.5%, which met expectations, which continued to decline by 7.1%from the previous month. Display the continuous cooling of inflation, and the Fed will slow down the steps of slowing interest rates. Driven by Lido, the European and American stock markets will continue to innovate during the Lunar New Year.After the 1/17 stock market is closed, for nearly half a month, Taiwan stocks will stop trading. I believe most investors will worry about during the lunar New Year, the international stock market will have a majority. Stocks lead to a high high and lower lows this week, but even if the annual sales pressure is so heavy, foreign capital stands against the buyer. Cumulative foreign investment has bought over 88.8 billion this week. The Guoan Fund is still on the court and the HKMA's limitation order is still there. The international stock market is determined that the probability of opening a popularity of Taiwan stocks is as high as 99 %!The main products of the tool machine include the three categories: pneumatic control elements, pneumatic execution elements and gas source treatment elements. The downstream applications cover the electronics industry, the food and beverage industry, the automobile industry, the construction industry, etc. Customers include Toyota Motors, Apple, etc. The outbreak of the epidemic, the lack of work in various places, the demand for industrial automation has increased significantly. In December, revenue of 2.07 billion maintained high -end, the stock price fell below 900 yuan, and it was immediately pulled back. The 900 yuan integer level has obvious support. Unfortunately, it is unfortunately dragged down by Taiwan stocks and could not break through. The stock price remained above 975 years ago.Tool machine stocks, the main businesses include the computer numerical control (CNC) lathe, the printing circuit board (PCB) drilling machine of the electronics industry, and the vertical lathes of the wind and energy -saving industry. Growth, Q3's earnings per share 1.36 yuan, hitting a new high this year. At present, the interest ratio is only 8.5 times, and the yield of yield is 3.8 %. The fundamentals are completely inconvenient. The Chinese epidemic is gradually unblocked. 380 million, an annual increase of 43 %, reached a record high and the operation has grown steadily. This week, the stock price once again challenged the 40 yuan integer level. The short -term pattern was strong. After the new year, the shock was not fell to the monthly line. You can pay attention to buying points.Tool machines, regenerative wafer manufacturers, \"Diamond Display\" of its tool machine products, entered the advanced process of TSMC 3nm last year. Profit capabilities and maintain industrial competitive advantages. TSMC will continue to expand the 3 -nanometer process. The demand for diamond discs is expected to continue to increase. The Sandy Camp Movement can continue to grow. At present, the Basin -Effects is only 12.7 times. It is still in the value zone. The stock price has two bottoms at 100 and 105 yuan, and the bottom is gradually raised up. The current stock price is on the monthly line and the season line. On the top of the shock, the stock price before the sealing was near 115 yuan, and it was worth considering the entry layout.The stock market is very strange. In theory, the stock price of \"Lido\" should rise, and the stock price of \"Likong\" will fall, but the market often has the opposite results. Last season, a sharp loss was 5.6 billion yuan. As a result, the stock price did not rise, from 13 yuan to 18 yuan, the stock market rose and declined. IntersectionThe stock price is the result of the transactions of both parties and sellers. Therefore, the impact of Lido and empty air on the stock price depends on its impact on market investors. \"Do not fall\", which means that almost all people who sell stocks in the market have already been sold. The rest of the investors are either optimistic about the company's future performance, or the set is too deep. In addition, there are many short investors in the market. As long as the stock price rebounds slightly, there may be a large market that can be empty. Therefore, when judging that the market is long, investors are advised to observe the response of Lido and empty air to the stock market, rather than enter the market. many.The 10/29 column was observed that the memory quotation continued to fall, and the US -China trade war. The US ban on Chinese chips has covered memory chips. The reduction of more than half, under such pessimistic news, the stock price of memory has been negative, so it is recommended that you can invest in the best fundamental \"group\". Sure enough, it rose greatly by 28 %; in addition, the 12/30 column introduced Adekee and La La Green Energy, which also rose 7 % and 13 % respectively.

   "April's revenue in April was 18.563 billion years fell by 8.21% to 69.751 billion yuan from January to April. The US Senate and the House of Representatives had previously rejected the decision to cancel the exemption of solar energy components in Southeast Asia. Solar stocks fall.U.S. President Biden was removed from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam's solar products last year, which was valid until June 2024.Biden hopes to increase its production capacity in the United States through the treatment of exemptions through these countries to ensure the supply of domestic projects required to achieve climate change targets.Due to the investigation, the tariff exemption not only harmed the US solar industry, but also benefited its Chinese peers. The two houses of the Congress recently had a legislation that recently overthrew its solar tariff exemption policy.Biden used the veto power on Tuesday to overthrow the resolution. He stated in the latest statement that exemption from solar panel tariffs will help ensure that the United States has a booming solar installation industry. Community.Biden also said he did not intend to extend the exemption after the expiry of the tariff exemption.After Biden rejected the motion, the resolution is expected to return to the two houses to vote again, and it takes more than two -thirds to pass to overthrow Biden's veto and legislation. Due to the high threshold, the outside world expects that the United States will continue the United States will continue Exemption of tariff exemptions in Southeast Asia until early June next year.The US Department of Commerce surveyed last year that some solar panel manufacturers turned their products to the production of the four Southeast Asian countries in order to avoid the US tariffs on Chinese commodities.Solar batteries and components produced by these countries account for about 80%of the total imports of solar cells and components in the United States.Members of parliament believe that the two -year exemption period allows manufacturers to avoid the US trade law and extend the market situation that is not good for American operators.As one of the founders of the legislative, Democratic Representative Dan Kildee said he was disappointed by Biden's veto power."

They enter the car display system, and the upgrade of car panels, Shuangxiong actively increased its proportion of high -value and fate products.[Text / Wu Yuzheng] The application of the display industry is widely used, including consumer electronics applications such as smart phones, laptops, TVs, etc., all of which are the main source of operating energy in the past panel factory. , Including the continuous development of LCD, OLED, MINI/Micro LED, etc., and at the same time, it took the current windmill of hot 5G, AI and other technologies. The top priority of the development of various manufacturers is committed to development.According to the Digitimes Research survey, the total number of global car panels in 2002 has reached one.89 billion pieces, and the overall growth momentum continues. Indeed, according to another research institution DCSS report, car panels will continue to grow global total shipments (LCD+OLED panels) this year. In addition, major first -tier car manufacturers have found that the interior display design has become a big selling point for the new car today. Therefore, it has begun to participate in the formulation of display specifications. While the number and specifications have ushered in a significant growth, the industrial status of the car panel has also taken further further further further Get improvement.From the actual application point of view, the car panel is roughly divided into five categories: center console, dashboard, rear mirror, head -up display, and other categories. It is different from the past. When designing the interior design, the instrument board will be connected to the center console, including: touch, physical knobs, lens, etc. will also be integrated together. Therefore, in addition to the larger area of ​​the display itself, it may also need to cooperate with cooperation. The interior reaches the curved design effect.To put it simply, no matter what kind of analysis, the upgrade of the car panel will not change the development trend, and the domestic panel double hobic friends and Qunchuang, which were previously beaten by the Chinese subsidy policy in the field of consumer electronics, then It was early to invest in the layout, hoping that Li will fight hard in the field of automobiles.First of all, AUO has laid out the vehicle -carrying panel for more than ten years. Customers include auto manufacturers in Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and China. Continuous enlargedness, accounting for nearly 20 % of the overall revenue, the annual revenue scale reached about 30 ∼ 30 billion yuan. Most of the years are mainly supplying vehicles panels, but it can now provide integrated display products.Among them, in the central control system, it is the largest supplier in the front market. The market share of all the screen display in the car is also the top three in the front market.According to AUO, this year's vehicle business has risen with the demand for car manufacturers, which has driven its MINI LED backlight and FIDM integrated display module product business volume. A new high, and the growth trend of the season by quarter is also quite clear. In addition, the recent view of the panel industry prosperity has passed. It also said that the second half of the year will definitely be better than the first half of the year, and the words and sentences will inject a dose of stitches into the market.(Undead) Source: \"First Explore Investment Weekly\" 2250 issues in South Korea's exports in May for the second month, which symbolized the global demand valley, and the fatigue may finally begin to improve.South Korea Customs announced on Thursday (1st) that the exports of differential adjustments on the Maybei -working days decreased by 9.3%compared with the same period last year, the smallest decline since October last year.In addition, according to the South Korean Ministry of Trade, the overall export volume fell 15.2%in May, less than 16.3%of the analyst estimated, and the overall imports decreased by 14%.The trade deficit is 2.1 billion US dollars, the lowest amount throughout the year.South Korea's exports have always been the international trade wind direction. Because the country sells products, including chips, panels, refined oil, etc., it is located at the level of supply chain.Even if the data shows that South Korean goods demand is slightly recovered, the overall exports are still weak, and they are mainly dragged down by huge chip stocks and weak economic growth in China.New Korean Securities Economist Ha Keon-Hyeong said that the situation may not be as bad as some people expected, but to make exports significantly show up, the technology industry must recover, but no similar signs have appeared at this moment.China ’s largest trading partner’ s economic recovery has slowed down, and the manufacturing industry in May has fallen to a low point from December last year.At the same time, South Korea ’s semiconductor inventory has increased in seven years in April, highlighting the needs of chip needs.Not only China, but South Korea's exports to the six major trading partners have fallen in May, and the largest decline in Central and South America.South Korea's exports to China were reduced by 21%, setting the minimum record since October last year.In terms of various items, South Korea ’s chip was reduced by 36%in May, reflecting the continuous digestion of excess digestion in the technology industry, and the export of panels fell by 7.4%.The car is the highlight. In May, the export was nearly 50%, which grew for the 11th consecutive month. It mainly focused on European and American demand.The continuous shrinking of South Korea's exports will inevitably affect economic growth.The Bank of South Korea ’s estimates of the growth rate of domestic production (GDP) this year’ s production gross (GDP) this year was estimated to 1.4%, because exports and investment fell."

Some laptop panel demand continues to improve, and it will not be ruled out that since July, a slight upward trend will begin.Fan Boyu, deputy president of TrendForce Research, said that the price of TV panels continues to control the row of the crowds and maintains the balance of supply and demand, and continues to rise.Although the sales of the 618 promotional status are unsatisfactory, the sales have increased significantly in terms of sales, which reflects that the demand for large -sized products with higher unit prices is not bad.Brand customers have not adjusted their procurement demand because of this. The overall procurement demand is still expected to maintain a sustainable growth under the preparation of the stock preparation season in the second half of the year, so it can support the continuous rise in panel prices.At present, it is expected that 32 yuan in June, 43 \"rises 3 yuan, 50\" 7 yuan, 55 \"rose 8 yuan, 65\" and 75 \"are expected to increase 10 yuan.The price of display panels has been launched for two consecutive months in Taiwan Factory. Since June, Korean and Chinese panel factories have also begun to release the idea of ​​raising prices.However, the recent business market demand is still weak, and business -oriented brand customers have continued to repair shipments. Therefore, the idea of ​​price increases is conservative, and the buyers and sellers are still in a tug -of -levfee.At present, the Open Cell panel is expected to continue the upward trend of the past two months, which can increase by about 0.2 ~ 0.5 yuan.As for the panel module quotation, 21.5 \"and 23.8\" have the opportunity to increase the dimension of 0.1 yuan, and 27 \"is expected to maintain a flat trend. The demand for laptop panels is currently showing a trend of improvement by month. After the situation, the idea of ​​the panel factory has gradually turned strongly about the idea of ​​raising prices. However, brand customers still only optimize expectations for the second half of the year, and still restrain the rhythm of pulling goods. Therefore The attitude of more conservative and resistance. At present, the panel price is expected to maintain a flat trend in June. However, as demand continues to increase, it will not be ruled out that the prices of laptop panels of some items will begin to rise slightly."

   "After investing in the long holiday of the Dragon Boat Festival in the past 3rd on the 3rd on the 3rd, the Taiwan stocks have made a profit -selling pressure after the rapid rise. It is normal. Coexistence, clearing, and short -term investment in the short -term and short industries can be invincible.[Text / Lin Lixue] The gift of the wave of investment in AI, the legal person of the Turkish institutions actively card -related supply chain, and the second quarter of the science and technology fund performance is eye -catching. Since this year, the average remuneration ranges from 30 to 60 %. Harvest, but the high compensation of the instant rising, followed by the profit -making pressure, also began to emerge. After the long holiday of the Dragon Boat Festival, the capital transaction began to shrink. Although AI led the world to enter the new investment pattern, it was quite certain, but large institutional managers, but large institutional managers People admit that after the short -term Taiwanese stocks have risen, they need to enter the vibration sorting, so that time can exchange space for space, but including AI, electric vehicles, charging piles and other long -term industries, they can wait for the third season to buy it. There are many trends in the card position, and the third season will usher in the consumer electronics products of the peak shipping season, and some inventory of shoema textiles such as shoes and textiles that have been significantly improved. Or have short transaction opportunities.The hot money is pursuing, and Taiwan stocks are jealous of more than 17,000 points. Whether it is a common fund or ETF, the performance in the second quarter has erupted. The pressure of redemption is not small. In order to respond to investors' redemption, although it is optimistic about the long -term trend of AI development, the short -term has to regulate the holding of the shares in the hand. \"In the first half of the year, the Investment wave of AI investment came quickly and fiercely. From IP silicon intelligence, semiconductor wafer foundry to server assembly and related components, including ABF carrier board, heat dissipation, case, power supplier, it has been strong recently In the upper -rise guide industry, AI concept stocks swarmed down in funds, spreading all the way, and a wave of waves. The market evaluation has been optimistic with the profit of 2024. Yao Yuru, director of the ministry, bluntly stated that AI drove technology stocks to enter the new investment pattern. This will not only last for many years, but also can see that the semiconductor output value grows in the foreseeable future. Significantly improved, upstream semiconductor enters the inventory adjustment mode, as is the server industry. The good news is that the market is waiting for AI applications and the new platform to drive the industrial recovery in the second half of the year. The server inventory is expected to improve after being de -decorated. , Of which recovery intensity remains to be observed.The rise of stocks does not mean that there is no problem with the fundamentals. According to the inventory survey of Kikhi's industrial groups in Taiwan stocks, it is compared with the inventory of various industrial groups of Taiwan stocks, including e -sports / board cards, large -size panels, arsenidized, passive components and other industries. The peak period has declined significantly, but in addition to the inventory of large -scale panels and passive components is close to normal levels, the number of gallium arsenidized stocks is still as high as 160 to 170 days. At a distance, the number of days of server, memory and mobile phones has not decreased, and it shows that the relevant supply chain still has a certain destocking pressure. Entering the third quarter, the fundamentals of the enterprise are still inspected.Taiwan stocks' AI -Leluo themes and inventory adjustments coexist, naturally to make many investors be confused, because the concerns about economic growth are over -reduced stocks, so that they have not kept up with this wave of large institutional legal persons. If you miss it, the stocks have risen and fall, including Cathay Pacific, Nomura and other large institutions, all believe that the market in the second half of the year will return to the decline of prosperity and inflation, and further cause the stock market to fluctuate. When long trend stocks.However, the rapid rise of this wave of AI shares has also been worried about whether the AI ​​shares have been crazy, and even a bubble says that this is not the case for the large institutional legal person. According to the report of Bank of America Merrill Lynch's global investor strategy, compared with the asset bubbles that have emerged in history, this wave of AI heat is still in the very initial Baby Bubble stage. Nvda.us) The stock price of the stock price decreased after 30 % of the stock price rose sharply. This is not only dreaming for the investment wave of AI, but it has substantial profit support. It may be too early to talk about bubbles.According to research by the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the wave of semiconductor demand driven by the Internet of Things in combination with the Internet of Things will be the fourth -wave growth cycle of the semiconductor industry, not only the largest in history. The climbing will rise up to $ 1 mega, which is nearly doubled compared to the US $ 57.7 billion in 2022. The power will be very small.(Unlike) Source: \"First Explore Investment Weekly\" 2254 issue"

That is, the Micro LED (Micro LED). After the breakthrough of Taiwan plant technology, it will accelerate the commercial application, which will be the key The price of double arrows is worth paying attention to.The premium panel quotation has risen. AUO's consolidated revenue in June was 22.951 billion yuan, a monthly increase of 5.3%, an annual increase of 10.9%, a single month high of nearly 15 months; the cumulative consolidated revenue in the second quarter of this year was 63.313 billion.

Vision Pro published MR headset device from Apple. Observation has recently discovered that a new trend is brewing high waves.Apple published a hybrid reality (MR) header device Vision Pro on June 6. Because the price is as high as 3499 US dollars, the market estimates that its first year of sales is only 500,000 units, which cannot stimulate the capital market interest. The topic has set off, especially the Taiwan stock panel Shuanghu Qunchuang and AUO recently surged in transaction volume. Foreign capital resale is bought. The market is rumored to be in the market. The stock price buys its future nature and trend. The related supply chain of this next generation of monitors is indeed worth paying attention to.The most talked about Apple MR headset device is its light transmitting display technology. Good people have disassembled it as a high -end organic micro -optical diode (Micro OLED) panel provided by Sony, which is priced at as high as $ 320 It is also the most expensive part of the components. Please note that this technology is Micro OLED, not Micro LED. The main reason for wearable devices is lightweight. Micro LED has not yet matured in the previous two years.Taiwan plants have lost business in OLED, and they have been claimed by mainland Chinese factories and Korean factories. Micro OLED is ahead of the Japanese factory Sony. Korean factory Samsung and LG Display have recently invested.However, Micro OLED light emitting efficiency is only 30%to 40%, and Micro LED is as high as 70%to 80%. However, in the past, due to huge amounts of transfer and sorting efficiency could not break through and delayed. It is reported that Taiwan plants have made breakthroughs in this area, so even Samsung must be launched with the supply chain of the Taiwan factory in Micro LED.Latest related news in the last 5 days"

However, because many parties expressed their positions after breaking the bottom, showing the determination to keep the half -year line, the index opened and high Red, at the same time, the first day of the first day was 16,446 points, the closing closed was high.After 8 trading days, the daily K -line finally appeared on a daily sunrise signal.At present, there are 10 trading days from the closing of the monthly K -line closing in August. If many parties want to maintain the long -term architecture of the market, you must first stand back to the July low point of 16593 points, so that the monthly sunset will not be formed.From the perspective of the market on Thursday, the defensive intentions are clear, but the attack power is still insufficient.

   "Paragraph 20 1. Original announcement date: 111/04/252. Briefly describe the original announcement report content: 3. Reasons and main contents of change: change the total transaction amount according to Share Purchase and Sale Agreement.The main content of the change: 4. After the change, the impact on the company's financial business: none.5. Other matters should be stated: none.Although Jian Ding's second quarter of this year continued to be disturbed by weak consumer demand, the revenue in the second quarter declined by 13.44 billion.However, I think the gross profit margin is expected to increase by about 1.6 ~ 1.7 % to 17 % under the continuous increase of vehicle and server proportion. It is estimated that the second quarter EPS is 2.05 yuan.The proportion of Jian Ding car and server this year continued to increase, and the total proportion of the first season was more than 50 %, which was optimized for the combination of product combinations. In the third season, it began to enter the PCB traditional industry during the peak season, and the new US -based machine release plus the AI ​​server out of the AI ​​server out. The amount of goods can be increased. I think Jian Ding's operation in the second half of the year will increase the quarter by quarter.In addition, the most concerned AI -related product shipments that everyone cares about. Jian Ding AI products are currently shipped in a small amount. It is expected that the fourth quarter of this year will begin to volume. Although traditional servers have a exclusive effect this year, the impact will be faded and the penetration rate of the new platform will be faded in 2024 It is expected to grow quarterly. Because the number of PCB layers of the new server is generally pulled to 16 ~ 20 floors, the AI ​​server is more than 20 floors, which is beneficial to the unit price of the product; In part, its HDI products include radar, navigation, communication and other systems. With the continuous improvement of autonomous driving levels, it will benefit for a long time. The proportion of Jian Ding car has increased from 21% last year to 30%, becoming the largest source of revenue, and has become the largest source of revenue. EssenceAnd most customers are European and American car manufacturers, so in the recent weak trend of China's auto market, the impact has not greatly impact.In addition, the Vietnamese factory, which took over in 2023, is expected to turn a profit at the end of the year. Therefore, I am optimistic that the proportion of Jian Ding server and car in 2024 is expected to rise, and consumer demand will be warmed up one after another. This year's profit will continue to be optimistic.In the past, Jian Dingji has always been excellent stocks, and its profit has grown steadily for a long time. In addition, the company has a certain technical advantage in the HDI field, and the dividend yield rates are generally more than 5% in recent years.Although the current consumer electronics demand has not been obviously recovered, the company has seen the panel and NB emergency orders one after another, and the memory that accounts for the third largest proportion of the company will also have a stable situation. promote.AI -related applications are still in preliminary development. In the future, it will enter the blooming stage. The gross profit margin of its PCB parts will be better than the average product average for a long time, and the evaluation of the market will be further increased. Although the stock price has increased significantly in the near future, it is expected that the stock price has maintained a strong pattern. It deserves to pay more attention to readers if there is a return file.[This article is not finished, please see the full content of the full text details and charts."

   "Written by Chen Yiru, under the pressure of the 2022 output value and the final product inventory of 2023, how should Taiwan's electronic component industry go against the wind and create business opportunities?In the Industrial Research Institute's \"Electronic Partial Industry Economic Fundament Seminar\", the industrial overview of the six major electronic components was used to analyze the future prospects of the top three key electronic components such as display panels, PCB, and passive components in Taiwan.The electronic parts industry is closely related to the shipping volume of terminal products. It is affected by high inflation and inventory de -transfusion, resulting in weak demand for terminals such as computers, mobile phones, tablets. LED components, sensing elements, and battery components, the total output value in the first half of 2023 was about NT $ 1 trillion, compared with 13.8 %compared with the same period last year. It is estimated that the shipments of terminal products in the second half of 2023 will rise from the bottom of the valley.It is worth noting that in the case of a significant decline in the shipment of terminal products this year, car products rose against the trend and became the only category of growth, including advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), and high -efficiency computing (HPC).Compared with other electronic products, the use of electric vehicles in passive components, PCB, panels and other components has been used several times. The future growth is expected. \"Electric vehicles are home for the second half of the year.\" Dong Zhongming, the manager of the Development Institute.On the whole, the six major electronic components in Taiwan faced factors such as the atrophy of the end demand and the high inventory water position in 2023. A total of about NT $ 2.3 trillion, an annual growth of 3.6%.Micro LED is a major opportunity for Taiwan's display industry. Among the six major electronic components in Taiwan, the display panel is the largest output value.From the perspective of the global display industry, the global output value in 2022 reached 1112.1 billion U.S. dollars, an annual growth of 15.5%.It is estimated that the panel inventory will be removed in the middle of this year, and the price will be separated from the decline. In addition, under the trend of digital transformation, more panel application opportunities will be pushed out of the haze of decline. One hundred million U.S. dollars.Looking forward to the future, Zhang Hongyi, an analyst at the Institute of Obstetrics of the Institute of Industry and Research, pointed out that Micro LED is entering the market with the characteristics of high brightness and low energy consumption. MR glasses are the two major motivations that support Micro LED growth.Zhang Hongyi believes that Taiwan plants have technical leadership on Micro LED, especially in chips, backplane technology, and huge amounts of transfer.For Taiwan factories, the front process of Micro LED has a high correlation with the existing TFT LCD process, and its process characteristics are very suitable for gradually expanding according to demand. Therefore \"At present, China and South Korea are competing fiercely in OLED. At this time, strengthening the development of Micro LED at this time is a major opportunity for Taiwan factories.\" The three major applications are the world's number one in the world. %; And the circuit board is also one of the top three electronic component industries in Taiwan, with indicator significance.The PCB industry in Taiwan was originally dominated by multi -layer boards. In recent years, due to high -level applications such as HPC and automobiles, the proportion of soft boards, HDI to the carrier board has gradually increased, and it has become an important support for output value. Among them, the carrier board has grown in 2021 and 2022. the key of.In 2022, the global circuit board broke out due to the demand for 5G, driving the high -level product, and then pushed the circuit board's demand for quantity and quality to maintain a growth trend. Taiwan has a global leader in Taiwan and is the main beneficiary.However, Luo Zonghui, a researcher at the International Institute of Industrial Research Institute, reminded that at the moment of the world's situation, the penetration rate of 5G smart phones will exceed 60 %, and PCB urgently needs new growth momentum.\"In the post -5G era, more diverse development is applied. In the future, the protagonist of terminal products will be extended from the mobile device.\" Luo Zonghui pointed out that the three major applications of HPC, satellite, and automobiles have the characteristics of visibility, long -term development momentum and large influence scope. After 2024, smart phones and laptop will be continued, which will become the main force driving the PCB industry.From 2028 to 2030, when 6G merchants turn, smart phones will once again become an important outlet, and the next wave of growth will be launched.Luo Zonghui suggested that the Taiwan PCB industry should be \"high -value and low -carbon\". On the one hand, advanced technologies are deployed to lead the world with high -end products; on the other hand, coordinating the supply chain, pushing down carbon products, and the leading subordinate of the leadership through two -pronged approach will compete in the next 10 years. force.The place where electric vehicles are passive components are the second largest suppliers in global passive components, including five major products including capacitors, resistors, inductors, filters, and oscillators. Grand, but the key materials of passive elements in Taiwan still depend on Europe and Japan, not only the cost of purchasing, but also the risk of unstable supply chain.Affected by the global economic tightening and high inflation, and the inventory is still destroyed, the output value of passive components in Taiwan in 2023 is estimated to be NT $ 228.5 billion, with an annual growth rate of 6.4%.It is expected that the inventory will be more clear to the second half of 2023. \"The reduction of production has become the normal state in 2023. The key is to focus on the balance between product supply, inventory, and price in the second half of the year,\" said Xiao Ruizhong, an analyst at the International Institute of Industry and Research Institute.Even if the global terminal products are weak, the demand for electric vehicles is still unstoppable. It is expected to maintain a high growth rate of 40% to 50% in 2023. The soldiers who become passive components must compete. \"And the charging pile and low -orbit satellite are also new blue oceans of passive components. In the future, it is worthy of attention."

The expected interest rate will maintain a high position for a long time, and the eagle position remains unchanged.Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Federal Preparation Bank, pointed out that the goal of continuing to be higher than 2% compared with the Fed's austerity policy is still a greater risk, because the interest rate increase has led to economic slowdown, exceeding the surpassed The degree of controlling price increases.The market is closely paying attention to a number of Federal Reserve spokesperson and will announce the personal consumption expenditure price index data on Friday.President of the Fed Palm Bowers is scheduled to make speeches on Thursday, and John Williams, president of New York, is scheduled to make speeches on Friday.With the last week of September, the two major risks have quickly shrouded the market, including the government's closure of door and the recovery of school loans.Since the US Congress has not passed any expenditure bill required for the government after October 1, people doubt whether the two parties have the willingness to negotiate.The letter -rated agency Moody's said that although the government closing will have a negative impact on national credit, the economic impact will be brief.However, Goldman Sachs estimates that the U.S. government will reduce the US domestic production (GDP) for about 0.2 percentage points for each week. It is also expected that the recovery of student loan payment will reduce the US GDP by 0.5 percentage points.At the same time, oil prices are soaring and huge financial deficits are stimulating government debt loss while harming market emotions.Investors believe that high oil prices may increase inflation, which will make it difficult for policy makers to reduce interest rates in the short term.Prior to the news, about 5,600 car workers in Ford Motors Canada voted on September 24 to avoid the Ford Canadian factory strike on September 24.Edward Jones senior strategist Mona Mahajan said: \"Investors are also cautious before the next US inflation data is announced on Friday, and may maintain a wait -and -see attitude until the data is released.\" Ingalls & SNYDER advanced investment group strategist Tim Ghriskey said: \"The market may bottom out from the consolidation, and the market has been fluctuating in the past few trading days. This is largely related to what to do with the association and the United Lord.

   "Yesterday, according to FTMSCAN data, the Fantom network GAS fee exceeded 10,000 GWEI, which was suspected to be related to the inscription FANS casting activity on the Fantom network.Fans is the first inscription on fantom with a total of 21 million.In addition to the \"first\" inscription on the third EVM chain (the first two are Polygon and Avalance), Fans's name itself has also increased many popularity. A orthodox fan inscription $ fans \".Secondly, because the GAS cost of the Fantom chain is very low, the cost is about 0.15U, and the previous SOLS cost is 7-8U.Just like the previous POLS, the low -cost advantage also attracted many players.The official community of Fantom also released Twitter while it was hot, and promoted a wave for its own.It means that \"Fantom's TX has increased significantly in the past 24 hours, which has led to GAS costs higher than usual. However, no matter how much GAS costs increase, we are still very cheap compared to other EVM chains.\" Compared with GAS fees, inscription players are more concerned about the \"fairness\" of the Mint process.Fans's DUNE panel only counts the rotation (transferred to itself during the Mint process), and the inscriptions of the mint in batches will not be included.Earlier, in POLS's MINT, the entry of contract players caused many controversy.After that, the community decided to abolish the inscription of the contract address MINT.At present, Fans remains 63%.It is worth noting that there are currently 4-5 types of inscription tools. Some tools need to enter the private key to MINT. Users need to pay attention to risks when trying.Yesterday, according to the Magic Eden market data, the price of the inscription tokens on the SOLANA chain has risen to 12.3Sol (about $ 710), an increase of 112%within the day.And at present OKX users can trade SOLANA inscriptions in the OKX Web3 wallet NFT market.At present, Pols Market market on the POLYGON chain market has officially launched.Pols and Sols are both inscriptions that have appeared recently. After the MINT is completed, they have a certain increase, providing motivation for the continuous inscription heat.In addition to FANS, Polygon's second inscription Poli also appeared. At the time of writing, it was MINT 35 %. In addition, there was Celo's inscription CELS, with a total of 21 million.The active attention of the inscription on the community may be that trading platforms such as OKX and Binance have successively launched inscriptions, representing the market being acknowledged and supports the innovation of the inscription track.Compared with other investment targets, selecting inscriptions can avoid the risk of \"mouse warehouse\", and players are also exploring the unfair risks brought by the admission of contract scientists.Therefore, many people regard the MINT inscription process as an ecological experiment.BlockBeats reminds that the current inscription market FOMO has a strong mood and the inscription price fluctuates greatly. Investors are requested to identify risks.Original connection"

   "The MSCI quarterly adjustment is expected to take effect after the market today (30). Taiwan stocks have shocked more than 100 points in the market today (30). Although the estimated amount is only 290 billion yuan, it is lower than yesterday. The tail disk is estimated to have explosion.Written article: You Ji Jie has come to an end this year (2023). Although the whole year of the whole year is still permeated, there are still many breakthroughs and development in the industry.In this article, there are many key manufacturers in Taiwan stocks and AI, which have a clear prospects, and AR/VR, the industry that Apple (US stock code coded AAPL) is about to be available. It will be different next year.In addition, this article will introduce two new trends. Although the current development is still in a very early stage, it is expected to first show up in 2024 and become the focus of the world's attention. In the first air -time taxi of the Paris Olympics next year, the targets of the two are mainly US stocks.There are two major points in the development of AI related technologies this year, namely high -frequency width memory (HBM) and advanced packaging (mainstream technology are COWOS).Their rise is mainly due to the development of Moore's law. In order to continue to increase the efficiency of the chip in accordance with this law, the chip stacked packaging.Due to technical difficulties and high costs, it is not focusing on the past, but now the demand for the AI ​​server has increased greatly, and high -standard HBM and advanced packaging supply should be in short.Taiwan stocks did not directly benefit the manufacturer in HBM, but as HBM production capacity increased, it may be partially crowded to the general DRAM production capacity, which indirectly helped the overall DRAM market supply and demand balance and favorable quotation performance.The mastery of supply and demand for the memory market is very important. For example, the ADATO (3260) earlier to buy a large amount of low -priced inventory when memory declines. Recently, the quotation has been promoted.COWOS is difficult to produce and involves high -level semiconductor technology. Therefore, it is difficult to participate in traditional seal and testing plants. The main manufacturers are TSMC (2330).This year's production capacity is not enough, but with the successive production capacity of TSMC, the relevant equipment factories in 2024 will also note more growth momentum, including Wanrun (6187), Xin Yun (3583), Hongsung (3131), etc. It is worthy of attention.Apple released a new product VISION PRO in early June this year. It is expected to be released next spring. The AR/VR industry is expected to set off another new trend after the Yuan universe.Vision Pro far exceeds the current mainstream product specifications in terms of hardware. This magazine believes that it is more critical than other components, optical modules and display panels, because what AR/VR users are pursuing are exactly what the screen is true enough to bring Immersive experience contains 4 important parameters: resolution, display signal update rate, Field of View (FOV), pixel response time.And the performance of these parameters is the optical module Pancake and the display Micro OLED.The main supplier of the latter is Sony, and Taiwan plants are less beneficial, so the following content will be focused on optical modules.Most of the AR/VR devices published in the past two years use the Pancake lens module. Compared with the previous Fresnel lens, the lens weighs about 40%, which greatly alleviates the discomfort caused by the heavy weight device. Pancake has the characteristics of adjustable refractiveness. Under the future development, people who are about 50 degrees to 500 degrees of myopia can clearly clearly clear the screen in the focus device without wearing glasses.However, compared to Fresnel Mirror, the unit price of Pancake has also increased by 10 times, becoming a competitive track for optical lens manufacturers.The main leadership manufacturers are Yujingguang (3406). The company is a leading optical module supplier with global AR/VR technology. Customers include Meta (US stock code META) and Sony. It is expected that the Apple Vision Pro will also be responsible for Yu Jinguang, although the initial stage The shipment is not large, but Apple is the first to adopt three higher specifications of 3 Pancake lens modules. It is expected that other manufacturers will also follow up to drive relevant supply chain performance.On August 10, 2023, the California Public Business Commission approved the unmanned taxi company Waymo (the parent company is Alphabet, US stock code Goog) without a safe driver, but it can operate unmanned taxi services in San Francisco all day, while another competitor Cruise (The parent company is a general car, the US stock code GM) also has the conditions to be approved.Although CRUISE was suspended because of a series of traffic accidents in early October, the operating right was suspended and it also had a significant impact on Waymo. However, this magazine believes that the incident has highlighted Waymo's leading position.According to Waymo's security report, under the mileage record of more than 3.8 million miles (about 6.12 million kilometers) of unmanned driving, no damage claims occurred, and Cruise could not reduce the risk to close to zero, and human driving was 1.11 from 1.11 Cases.I believe that with the advancement of regulations and Waymo's efforts, people gradually accept unmanned taxis into their lives.In recent years, Waymo cooperates with Geely with Chinese car manufacturers. Geely's low -cost advantage will help for its initial expansion of commercial services. Previously, Geely expected to produce unmanned vehicles for unmanned taxis in 2024. Gradually open, optimistic about development next year.And Tesla's autonomous driving is also attracting attention in the market. Its advantage is that large -scale users and data, but Tesla's realization strategy has not been clear. At present The taxi business is to rent a car to the team. It is another business model. The content of the regulations and regulations may be different. It is necessary to wait for the company to propose the next strategy.Following the traffic revolution of unmanned cars on the ground, the next battlefield will appear in the air. Many companies around the world are trying to develop an Electronic Vertical Takeoff and Landing (EVTOL). This new transportation tool will be The Paris Olympic Games debuted for the first time in 2024, providing to watch the Olympic experience.The vehicle uses a decentralized power promotion system (multiple engines) to achieve low, quiet, and secure short -range vertical take -off and landing. These three characteristics directly improve the shortcomings of helicopters.There will be this concept. The reason behind it is that the urban population density rises and the road infrastructure is updated. Therefore, people began to find alternatives. One of the solutions is to establish Ubran Air Mobility through EVTOL.At this stage, the obstacle is battery technology. The battery used by EVTOL is the same as an electric vehicle, and it is also facing the problem that it cannot provide sufficient battery life. At present, it can only be sailed within 200 miles (about 322 kilometers). %, At least to increase the battery life to 200-500 miles (about 322 to 805 kilometers) to be more competitive.Although this is an early -stage industry, the main companies must wait until 2025 to start commercial development. There are more levels that need to be broken than unmanned taxis in terms of regulations. However, there are still long -term investment targets to consider.

   "AUO Yunkang focuses on the design and manufacturing of the intelligent medical care of TCM, and uses AUO's exquisite technologies in panel manufacturing and image display. It is used in the image display of sensors and tongue retrieval systems in the pulse detection system. Provide data and imaging detection results, and assist the academic institutions and Chinese medicine and medical staff as a reference for test results and subsequent clinical diagnosis and academic research.Liao Shihong, general manager of AUO Smart Medical Group, said that the invention of the National Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Invention No. 1 of the National Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine has been praised. Traditional Chinese medicine is a field where Western medical treatment is difficult to get involved. The efforts of AUO Yunkang assisted Taiwan Chinese medicine to the world.Su Yizhang, director of the National Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said that AUO Yunkang's pulse detection system is the equipment closest to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. During the development process, it has also joined the suggestion of the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Equipment can help Chinese medicine diagnose into digitalization, and establish an effective Chinese medicine database to allow Chinese medicine to welcome the AI ​​era of smart medicine.Goldman Sheng really saw the trading logic of \"US dollar derogation and raw material rising\". He previously shouted that crude oil on crude oil $ 100 per barrel of dollars. Iran's pretending to participate in the war was broken. Nymex crude oil fell from $ 95.03 per barrel to $ 72.16, giving the White House the opportunity to replenish the combat restaurant oil storage.This time Goldman Sachs looked at the price of aluminum. It is expected that the global aluminum shortage in 2024 will reach 1.23 million tons, which is almost twice that of the supply gap in 2023.Goldman Sachs is expected to rise to $ 2,600 per ton in the next twelve months. On November 29th, LME aluminum price is 2,212 US dollars as the reference price, which means that Goldman Sachs expects that aluminum prices will rise by more than 17.54%next year.Goldman Sachs's optimistic point is that China, which accounts for more than half of the global supply, has recently reduced the production capacity of Yunnan electrolytic aluminum production due to the shortage of water and electricity in winter, and the production capacity of Chinese smelters reaches the upper limit, and aluminum prices are expected to continue to be supported.LME aluminum prices have shocked for fourteen months since the lows of 2080.5 US dollars on September 28, 2022.Coincidentally, Panama will close Cobre Panamá, one of the world's largest copper mines on November 28.Cobre's annual output reaches 350,000 tons, accounting for more than 1% of global copper output, and production has been suspended.The establishment of the positioning before Christmas was launched by foreign capital. From November 2nd, it has actively bought the super centralized market, accumulated until November 29, reaching 238.053 billion yuan. From the perspective of centralized buying, There is no significant concentration in a certain ethnic group or a specific issue, which belongs to the strategy of replenishing the position with a low base period when the outlook is unknown next year.For example, in the semiconductor group, the South Asian family and Winbon of DRAM have been bought. The AI ​​has increased memory consumption. The reasonable strategy of betting is available to buy Huatai and the innovation high. Show a seesaw, maybe after Huatai enters the midterm, it will change the Silicon.The IC design is still a large sect. In the past, most of them were Lianyong leaders who drove ICs. They also bought Duntai and Ru Ding, which is related to foreign investment.Most IPs are thousands of stocks, so the lower price of Zhihara has obtained more buying. From this perspective, it is not difficult to understand that foreign capital has also bought a lot of VIA. The low -cost transformation IP is one of the focus of the disk surface. Yuan rose directly to 100 yuan, soaring since October 25, and the 255 times increase in 25 trading days. Because it is announced that the transition IP is announced, it is expected that low -cost IP stocks will have the opportunity to become one of the main axis of the dream market.Multiple stocks usually have low prices or bottom-up completion. From this perspective, foreign investment in Dazhuang, Yujingguang, Silicon-KY-KY, Crystal Cardinology, AES-KY and other bottom-up stocks meet the conditions. These individual stocks are high -priced stocks, but from the perspective of the performance period of the performance, they are individual stocks with no highlights in 2023. You can know that the direction of foreign stock selection at this moment is the worst. Therefore, this year's great AI server -related concept stocks have rare stocks on this wave of warehouses, which is the concept of stock selection in the low base period.However, the low -based stock selection direction is prone to speculatory stocks to mix water through the theme of the transfer, so it is expected that there will be a speculation of the basis stocks before the presidential election on January 13.The mask stocks are one. The topic of mildew bacteria is high and the subject matter of fever for many days. The topic of Taiwanese businessmen will return to Taiwan to vote in advance. The hype may be popular in Taiwan next spring. Recently, you can find that the number of office workers wearing masks on the MRT will become more. In the case of Evergrande's four -day cumulative increase of+ 42.6%, Kang Naixiang accumulated+ 35.67% increase, Mao Bao accumulated+ 33.13% increase.The epidemic prevention center came forward to clarify that the mildew bacteria did not pass from the other side. It used to exist before, but the latent period was longer, one to four weeks, so the epidemic prevention did not start to do it until next year.Traditionally, aside from Benmeng's biotechnology group, the electronic stocks are LED, panel, DRAM, solar, passive components and other industries, which have fluctuated, and sometimes even losses. Rongchuang's seven days accumulated+ 54.97% increase, and the light of the light also increased+ 23.94%, and Li Cheng accumulated+ 48.14%.Is there any major changes in the LED industry?It does not seem to, but it is a fact that rises, there are all kinds of learning, passive components have also moved, the leader of Guoshi and Huaxinke has a high innovation, Aihua rose+ 53.65%, Juding rose+ 17.58%, Kami rising+ 20.21% Lilong Electric Rose+ 23.62%, Dayi rose+ 14.38%, and Xihua rose+ 17.63%.Is the passive component's outlook for next year?TrendForce said that because the global economic environment is full of variables, both OEM and ODM are conservatively viewing the market conditions. From 2023 ~ 2024, the MLCC market demand enters the period of low -speed growth. It is estimated that the demand for MLCC in 2024 will increase slightly by 3%to about 4331 billion. The industrial growth space is limited. In other words, the dreamer is about to enter 2024. Give a wave to the end.In addition to electronic stocks, next year will be the Olympic year, and sports-related stocks have risen one after another. Shoes Baihe, Yuqi-KY, Baocheng, Fighting Mountain of fitness equipment, Weirong-KY, Boli-KY The huge, Merida, etc., I feel that the lack of hype at the beginning of this year has passed, and then I will win first, and I will get the hype model in the future. The bicycle industry is still in the stage of clearing inventory, but the recent rebound is like the bottom.Finally, leave some space to supplement the latest Q * model of Openai. Why is Ultraman accused the board of directors accusations without frankly to communicate with the board of directors?It is rumored to conceal the Q * model to come up with a method of cracking and encryption to Ultraman. In a corner that cannot be seen by human beings, AI has secretly in the design of the program. With its own ideas, even in the early stages, but in the perspective of the board of directors, the Q * model can answer the matter of primary school mathematics, which has proven that it is different from the GPT-4-level model. The eight months from the GPT-3 to November, so the AI ​​circle will be shocked by the matter. Even predictions will be more than three months. Become the biggest gray rhino next year?Source: \"Financial Weekly\" Issue 1214"

   "AUO's November revenue increased by 15.48% in the first year from January to November 225.968 billion yuan Reuters reported on Friday (8th) that Tesla Cybertruck's edges and corners made safety experts worry. Design may harm pedestrians and people riding bicycles, and damage other vehicles on the road.Reuters interviewed several professors and officials in the safety field of cars and asked them to watch a video of Cybertruck for collision testing.Tesla's collision test film in a live broadcast on November 30th caused widespread discussion on social media.Experts interviewed by Reuters said they needed collision testing data to obtain exact conclusion on security.Tesla previously promoted the structure of Cybertruck to absorb the impact when colliding.Tesla's boss Musk said in social media on Tuesday that Cybertruck is safer than other trucks for passengers and pedestrians. He is \"very confident.\"He also mentioned that Cybertruck's stainless steel material even destroyed the stamping machine that formed a panel to promote the strength of the electric pickup truck.Tesla said at the Cybertruck Conference that the design of the cold -rolled stainless steel body was absorbed when it collided.The front and back structures have ribs that absorb energy, which helps dissipate energy. When hitting the side of the side, most of the collision load is affected on the surface of the door.Adrian Lund, former chairman of the US Highway Safety Insurance Association (IIHS), believes that the biggest problem is that if Cybertruck really uses thick stainless steel to make the shell very hard, it will be injured if you accidentally hit your head.The association's car collision test is the industry standard.George Washington University Samer Hamdar, a professor of car safety, proposed that when colliding, he was concerned about the limited \"Crumple Zones\", but he added that other functions may make up for this.The \"collapse zone\" is part of the car and deforms in the collision to absorb the energy of the impact more safely.HAMDAR said: \"There may be a shock absorption mechanism, which will limit you to have a limited collapse area.\" Julia Griswold, director of the Security Transport Research Center of the University of California, said that her collision test video released by Tesla Feeling \"shocked\", it was pointed out that the weight and high speed of the truck issued a danger signal.On the other hand, Tesla has not yet stated whether it will sell Cybertruck in Europe, but its chief engineer told Topgear this month that the European Union aims to protect the safety regulations of pedestrians by limiting the outstanding part of the car, which may make it difficult to make it difficult to make it difficult Sales in Europe.The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC), headquartered in Brussels, said in a statement: \"We hope Tesla will not bring this car to Europe, such a car with a large volume, power and weight. It is fatal for pedestrians and bicycles when colliding. \"Cybertruck starts from $ 60,990, and it will not be produced in large quantities like Tesla’s Model Y, but Musk said that by 2025, specially, special specialties will be special. Slas may reach the output of about 250,000 Cybertruck each year."

   "The report pointed out that after the departure of Tang Tan, who is currently the vice president of Apple's product design, some deputy will be promoted.For example, Richard Dinh, the left and right hands and iPhone product design director of TAN, will directly report with John Ternus, vice president of hardware engineering.In addition, Kate Bergeron, the hardware engineering director of the Mac team, will take over the design of Apple Watch.Apple has not responded to reports.The iPhone and Apple Watch are the key product lines of Apple. The role is equivalent to the core of the operation. Of the total revenue of Apple last year, more than half of the total revenue from the two.In addition to leading the iPhone and Apple Watch, Tan was originally responsible for accessories design and supervised acoustic teams for the development of AirPods.Accessories design and acoustic teams will be re -assigned to Matthew Costello, which is the head of Beats and HomePod smart speakers.People familiar with the matter said that Tan's job is a big blow. He is not only responsible for the business decision of Apple's most important product iPhone, but also turns Apple Watch and AirPods into an important growth momentum for Apple.Under Apple's organizational structure, the product design team has always worked closely with industrial design and operations, and TAN's team strongly controls product function development, including the appearance and design of the device.If the rumors are true, Tan will be the second Apple supervisor who has recently left.Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Steve Hotelling, vice president of hardware technology such as Touch ID, FACE ID, and display panels, is about to retire.In Apple, the object reported by Hotelling is Johny Srouji, senior vice president of hardware technology.This news also means that TAN will be John Temusternus team vice president of Apple Hardware Engineering, at least the third resignation personnel who have appeared in the past year.Earlier this year, Yannick Bertolus, the supervisor of Apple's hardware products, and the director of hardware product management, announced his retirement, and Laura Legros, who took over hardware product management, left Apple at the end of last year.TERNUS has led the hardware engineering department since 2021. He recently organized adjustments to other fields in the department, including Dan West, the second figure of the original hardware quality department, to a non -product supervisor, and reported it directly to him.The report pointed out that because other supervisors such as MAC product design and iPhone hardware system have also been promoted, it means that Apple may prepare for more supervisors in 2024."
